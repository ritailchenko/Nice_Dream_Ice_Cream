          <p>Our story begins in the winter of 2011 with a few former musicians in Philadelphia, and a vision of an Ice Cream company which would serve as the nexus between their past and future creative lives. Ice Cream, they figured, could bring people together, could make people happy, and could provide a unique opportunity to subvert people’s expectations and encourage new experiences. 
          <br>
          <br>
          So that summer, they scooped their homemade Ice Cream from "The Flavor Blaster One", a custom built, multimedia tricycle: a mobile fun zone; a situationist spectacle; a joy on three wheels; and according to the Department of Health, a "Push Cart Food Retail Non-Permanent Location". They played their Music For Ice Cream, a generative musical environment derived from a hacked music box. They presented unusual flavors that no one had imagined before. They presented flavors made without dairy, because Ice Cream is for Everyone. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In the spring of 2012, they built three additional tricycles and began extended service throughout the greater Philadelphia region at concerts, festivals, farmers’ markets, movies, birthday parties, weddings, roller derbies, book releases, office parties, and more.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
          <p>On Friday, August 3rd of 2012 they opened up their first shop called “World Headquarters”, located in the East Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia at 2311 Frankford Avenue -- a space shared with the world’s first and only pizza memorabilia museum, Pizza Brain. On this very same day, “This is a Special Time”, a video work produced for the company by Doug Garth Williams, was released and swiftly took the Internet by storm. As of this writing, it has attracted nearly one million views on www.YouTube.com. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In the spring of 2013, on Saturday, April 20th, Little Baby’s opened up its second shop, which was dubbed “Cedar Park Embassy” in recognition its location in the Cedar Park neighborhood of West Philadelphia, at 4903 Catharine Street. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Today, they continue to sling their scoops throughout the great City of Philadelphia and beyond, and continue their mobile operations as far as their expanding base of Ice Cream fans will bring them. Their catering and events staff is known to serve waiting, open mouths throughout Southeastern PA, Lehigh Valley, New Jersey, Delaware, Baltimore, and Washington, DC. Their pints are available in a rapidly growing number of fine food retailers.</p>
